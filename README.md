### 📈 Advertisement Strategy

We performed a "Return on Ad Spend" (ROAS) analysis to determine the best times and locations to advertise:

- **Top States and Months for Ad Spend**:
  - **California** → March
  - **Washington D.C.** → September
  - **New York** → August

---

### 🔁 Product Returns

- Subcategories with high return rates:
  - 📦 Paper
  - 📦 Binders
  - 📦 Phones (still profitable)

> ⚠️ *Note:* 'Paper' had an abnormally high return rate despite its profitability. This should be investigated further.

## ✅ Recommendations

### 🔻 Discontinue
- **Tables**
- **Binders**

### 🔄 Reposition or Market Differently
- Products with low return rates but poor sales may benefit from:
  - Targeted marketing campaigns
  - Product repositioning to different customer segments

### 🚀 Improve Product Offering
- Consider bundling, rebranding, or enhancing product features.

### 💵 Pricing Optimization
- Test seasonal pricing or promotional discounts to improve profitability without increasing return rates.
